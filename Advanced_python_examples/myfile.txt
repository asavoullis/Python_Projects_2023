Software development is the process of creating, designing, and maintaining computer programs and applications.
Coding involves writing instructions in a programming language to create software solutions.
Version control systems like Git help developers collaborate on code, track changes, and manage projects efficiently.
Debugging is a crucial skill in software development, involving finding and fixing errors in code to ensure its functionality.
Agile methodologies promote iterative development, allowing teams to adapt and deliver working software in short cycles.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) emphasizes organizing code into reusable objects, enhancing modularity and maintainability.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) enable different software components to communicate and interact with each other.
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices streamline development by automating testing and deployment.
Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to solving complex problems efficiently and optimizing software performance.
Documentation is essential in software development, providing clear explanations of code, functionality, and usage for developers and users alike.
