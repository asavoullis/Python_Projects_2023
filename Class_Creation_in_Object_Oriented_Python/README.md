# Python Class Examples

This Python script, `classes_examples.py`, provides examples of how to work with classes in Python. It covers various tasks related to class definitions, constructors, getters and setters, creating a string representation of objects, and sorting objects.

## Usage

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Save the `classes_examples.py` script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python classes_examples.py
```

## Script Overview

The script demonstrates the following tasks related to classes:

### Task 1: Class Definition

- A class `Car_default` is defined with default attributes assigned to instances of the object.

### Task 2: Constructor and Default Values

- A class `Car` is defined with a constructor (`__init__`) that allows the creation of objects with specified attributes. If an attribute is not provided during object creation, default values are used.

### Task 3: Getters and Setters

- A class `Car_advanced` showcases the use of getters and setters. Getters provide access control, and setters provide protection for attributes. The example includes decorators and uses `_` to indicate that an attribute should not be changed directly.

- An additional example, `Product`, demonstrates a class with getters and setters for price manipulation.

### Task 4: String Representation

- The class `Car_adv2` illustrates how to create a string representation of the object using the `__str__` method.

### Task 5: Sorting Objects

- The class `Car_adv3` demonstrates reading data from a file, extracting data from each entry, creating objects, adding objects to a list, sorting the list of objects, and printing them.

## Example Usage

The script provides example usage for each task, showcasing how to create instances of classes, access attributes, and manipulate data.

Feel free to explore and modify the script to understand how classes work in Python.
