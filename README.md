Folder: [Statistical_Analysis_using_Python_Numpy](https://github.com/asavoullis/Python_Projects_2023/tree/main/Statistical_Analysis_using_Python_Numpy)

[Statistical_Analaysis_Scores.ipynb](https://github.com/asavoullis/Python_Projects_2023/blob/main/Statistical_Analysis_using_Python_Numpy/Statistical_Analaysis_Scores.ipynb)

This project employs a two-sample T-test to assess the significance of math test scores among male and female students. Analyzing sample sizes, mean scores, and standard deviations, it aims to uncover substantial differences. Key steps involve data segregation, pooled variance computation, T-value calculation, and P-value determination. The project evaluates the null hypothesis stating no significant divergence in math scores. If the P-value is below a chosen threshold (e.g., 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a noteworthy gender-based performance gap. This analysis informs data-driven educational decisions regarding gender-based disparities in academic performance.

Folder: **[Vocabulary_Quiz](https://github.com/asavoullis/Python_Projects_2023/tree/main/Vocabulary_Quiz "Vocabulary_Quiz")**

### [Quiz_advanced_OOP.py](https://github.com/asavoullis/Python_Projects_2023/blob/main/Vocabulary_Quiz/Quiz_advanced_OOP.py)

The Vocabulary Quiz Game is an engaging and educational application designed to enhance vocabulary skills through interactive gameplay. Developed using the Tkinter library in Python, it offers three distinct game modes to cater to various player preferences and skill levels.

In "Play with Lives" mode, players have limited lives and must choose the correct word meaning from options, striving to maximize their score while conserving lives. "Time Attack" mode challenges players to answer word meaning questions within a fixed time, encouraging quick thinking and accumulation of high scores. "Warmup" mode provides a stress-free practice environment for beginners to familiarize themselves with word meanings and definitions.

The game is available in three versions: terminal-based, GUI-based (Non-OOP), and GUI-based with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. While the terminal version suits command-line enthusiasts, the GUI versions offer visually appealing interfaces for interactive gameplay. The OOP version enhances code modularity and maintainability through class-based organization.

Word data is sourced from a CSV file, and player progress is displayed on the GUI, including lives (in the first mode), scores, and informative messages.

With its versatility and educational value, the Vocabulary Quiz Game provides an enjoyable platform for vocabulary enrichment. Players of all backgrounds can select their preferred version and embark on an engaging word-learning journey.
