# Simple Captcha Generator

This is a simple captcha generator implemented in Python using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module. It generates a random captcha text, draws it on an image, and saves the image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
````

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/captcha-generator.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd captcha-generator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the `captcha_generator.py` script to generate a captcha image:

```bash
python captcha_generator.py
```

This will create a captcha image named `captcha.png` in the current directory.

## Customization

You can customize the captcha size, characters, and length in the `captcha_generator.py` script.
