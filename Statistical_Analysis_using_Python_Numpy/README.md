# Statistical Analysis of Scores

## Goal

The goal of this project is to find the statistical significance of student test data from two different student groups using a two-sample T-test. We will analyze the test scores of male and female students and determine if there is a significant difference in their math scores.

## Introduction

The T-test is a widely used statistical method to test hypotheses using sample data from populations. To perform the T-test, we need the following information:

- Population sample sizes.
- The mean (average) of each population.
- Standard deviation of each population.

In this analysis, we will calculate the pooled variance and perform a two-sample T-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in math test scores between male and female students.

## Results Description

After conducting the analysis on the math test scores of male and female students, we obtained the following results:

- **Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference in math test scores between males and females.

We performed the following steps to analyze the data and test the hypothesis:

1. We filtered the dataset to obtain math test scores for female students and male students separately.

2. We computed the pooled variance, which accounts for the size difference between the two groups.

3. Using the pooled standard deviation and the difference between the means, we calculated the T-value.

4. The degrees of freedom were determined to be equal to the sum of the sample sizes of the two groups minus 2.

5. Finally, we computed the P-value using the T-value and degrees of freedom.

## Conclusion

The statistical analysis revealed the following:

- The T-value obtained from the analysis was [insert T-value].
- The P-value obtained was [insert P-value].

Based on our analysis, we can draw the following conclusions:

- If the P-value is less than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a statistically significant difference in math test scores between male and female students.
